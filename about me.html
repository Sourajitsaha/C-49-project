        Hi, Iâ€™m Jo Nakashima. I am a brazilian nikkei and origami artist/youtuber. It all began in 2007 when I uploaded my first videos teaching simple origami models, but I only started working seriously on my channel in 2009. In 2010 it became my full time job and I also started creating my own models in this year. Since then I have created over 150 original models, but I still teach also works from other origami artists.
